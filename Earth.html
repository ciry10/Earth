<p id="p1">Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical object known to harbor life. It has a diameter of about 12,742 kilometers (7,918 miles) and is the fifth-largest planet in the Solar System. Earth is composed primarily of rock and metal, with a solid crust, a viscous mantle, and a core made mostly of iron and nickel. The planet's atmosphere is rich in nitrogen and oxygen, which supports a diverse range of life forms. Earth has one natural satellite, the Moon, which influences tides and stabilizes the planet's axial tilt. The planet's surface is covered by about 71% water, primarily in the form of oceans, with the remaining 29% consisting of continents and islands. Earth's climate and ecosystems are shaped by its position in the habitable zone around the Sun, allowing for liquid water to exist on its surface.</p>
